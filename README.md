## 🎯 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict loan payment statuses accurately. By doing so, it offers lending institutions enhanced risk assessment, decision-making processes, and the potential to minimize financial losses.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comes from **LendingClub**, a prominent peer-to-peer lending platform in the United States. Each row represents a unique loan, and each column represents a different loan attribute, including:
- Loan amount
- Term
- Interest rate
- Grade, sub-grade
- Employment title, employment length
- Home ownership
- Annual income

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 🧹 [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/MaSOouD69/Loan-prediction/blob/main/1.%20data_cleaning.ipynb)
We started by tidying up the dataset: removing irrelevant features, handling missing data, and eliminating any features not available at loan issuance time.
